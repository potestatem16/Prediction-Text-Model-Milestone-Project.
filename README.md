# Prediction-Text-Model-Milestone-Project.

The goal of the project is to build a predictive text model. The model will be implemented with a shiny app UI that will predict the next word as the user types a sentence. 

It is intended to simulate the functionality of the keyboards of current smartphones, which use the technology of the Swiftkey company.
